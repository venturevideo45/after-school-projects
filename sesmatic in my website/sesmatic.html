**Fortnite** is a popular online multiplayer game developed 
by Epic Games, known for its colorful graphics, fast-paced
action, and creative gameplay. It combines elements of
shooting, building, and survival, where players compete
to be the last one standing in its famous *Battle Royale*
mode. Fortnite also features a *Creative* mode, allowing
players to design their own worlds and games, and *Save the World*,
a cooperative mode where players fight against zombie-like creatures.
The game is regularly updated with new skins, weapons, and crossover
events featuring characters from movies, comics, and pop culture,
making it one of the most dynamic and engaging games in the world.
