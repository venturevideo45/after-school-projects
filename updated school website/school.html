A school is a place where students come to learn, grow, and build
 the foundation for their future. It is filled with classrooms, 
 playgrounds, libraries, and laboratories that help students explore 
 both knowledge and creativity. Teachers guide and inspire students 
 to develop good habits, discipline, and a love for learning. Beyond academics, 
 schools also encourage teamwork, friendship, and respect for others through various 
 activities and events. It is a second home where children not only gain education
  but also learn the values that shape them into responsible and confident individuals.
